-- Day 28 â€“ Joins in SQL (Part I)

/* Types of SQL Joins:-
   1. INNER JOIN: Retrieves records with matching values in both tables.
   2. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN): Retrieves all records from the left table and matching records from the right table. 
      Non-matching records in the right table result in NULL
   3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Retrieves all records from the right table and matching records from the left table. 
      Non-matching records in the left table result in NULL.
   4. FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN): Retrieves all records from both tables, with NULL for non-matching rows in either table.
   5. CROSS JOIN: Combines all rows from both tables, resulting in a Cartesian product.
   6. SELF JOIN: Joins a table to itself. */
